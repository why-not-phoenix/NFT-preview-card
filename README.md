## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- Might seem a bit unnecessary but I got forced to learn how to use GitHub and the difference  between Git and GitHub (still on this).
- Improved on using descendant combinators and adjacent sibling combinators.
- Hopefully I learned more than I'm able to list here :).

### Continued development

- I realized that I needed to learn about a lot more selectors and their functions.
- Still have a hard time structuring with CSS.
